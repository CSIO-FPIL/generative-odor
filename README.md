# Navigating the Fragrance space Via Graph Generative Models And Predicting Odors
We introduce a suite of generative modelling techniques to efficiently navigate and explore the complex landscapes of odor and the broader chemical space. Unlike traditional approaches, we not only generate molecules but also predict the odor likeliness and classify probable odor labels. We show that odor likeliness is a function of physicochemical features. Additionally, we identify the most relevant features to construct an odor likeliness equation and leverage SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to demonstrate the interpretability of the work. The whole process involves four key stages: molecule generation, stringent sanitization checks for molecular validity, fragrance likeliness screening and odor prediction of the generated molecules. By making our code and trained models publicly accessible, we aim to facilitate broader adoption of our research across applications in fragrance discovery and olfactory research.
